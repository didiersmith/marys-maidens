## 0. The Floor

"Morning, Mr. Miskewitz," the security guard greeted him as they entered the foyer. "Who have we got here?"

"He's from Unimaiden," Tyler said, and nodded at the prick. "Our esteemed guest."

"Of course," the security guard smiled. "You don't happen to have ID on you?" he asked the esteemed guest.

The security guard hummed a little as he copied the prick's ID number into the visitor log. He didn't seem too stressed - he'd probably already realized that the facility would still need security post-merger. Likely even more. 

"Here you go," the guard said as he handed the prick's driver's license back. "Hope you like what you see."

"I can't wait," the prick replied. "Let's start with the hatchery."

The security guard pressed the button on his desk and a door opened on the left side of the foyer.

Tyler led the prick into the corridor. The doors closed behind them, and a second set opened in front. Preparing himself for more ridicule, Tyler steeled his nerves and led the prick into the darkness of the hatchery.

"You can't be serious," the prick said, after their eyes had adjusted to the dim amber light. "Are these the wombs?"

"What?" Tyler asked. "They're top of the line."

"They're singles! Top of the line for a mom and pop shop, maybe. How many you running?"

"Eight hundred."

The prick burst out laughing. "Eight hundred individual wombs! You never heard of batch processing?"

"Individual processing allows us to target each specimen's unique needs, ensuring optimal-"

"Cut the marketing shit, Mr. Miskewitz. Fetuses don't have unique needs. Oxygen, carbon, vitamins and minerals, just like every other mammal. Let me guess, you could never afford the capital expenditure of upgrading to batch?"

"We tune our folate supply according to the unique genetic makeup of-"

"Yeah, yeah, whatever. We'll take care of it. Show me the nursery."

Tyler swallowed his pride and led the prick past the mismatched racks of single wombs. They really had all been top-of-the-line - back when they were new. Now that the oldest generations were long past their warranty periods and one of the main womb vendors had gone out of business, an increasing fraction of the equipment was held together with Flex-Seal and crossed fingers. Still - if it ain't broke...

The delivery room was empty - still twelve weeks until Batch 46 was ready. Then it would be a madhouse for five days - the place would be crawling with temps running back and forth, cracking open the eggs and hooking the bubs up. Gastric tube, catheter, poop chute, _Cocomelon_. Not complicated, but someone always managed to screw it up. Historical data indicated an expected 95% yield - 760 bubs for the nursery.

"Looks clean," remarked the prick. No other comments.

The nursery was bustling. Batch 45 was in that awkward phase where some of them were starting to crawl, but others were content to lie on their backs all day, happily absorbing the hypnotic melodies and visuals of _Cocomelon_. Waste tubes had to come out of the crawlers, or they'd get tangled. Dozens of nurses in purple scrubs chased after the crawlers, keeping them from hurting themselves, changing their diapers, and pumping fortified organic goat milk into their gastric tubes.

"They're differentiating," the prick remarked. "Looks labour intensive."

Tyler nodded. "It's the most expensive stage in the process," he said. "But it's only for a few weeks."

"Are these nurses temp?"

"No. The work is too specialized. We reallocate them from the other batches and just go light on supervision for a month."

The prick shook his head. "You never studied process engineering, did you? This is where you should go continuous. Graduate the items immediately when they start crawling. Your single wombs could actually help here - if you spread out the load, you'd have constant resource demand instead of these insane spikes."

"The word 'batch' is literally in our name. It's not Mary's Continuous Process Maidens."

The prick laughed and changed the subject. "Do you rotate the staff?"

"Of course."

"How?"

"We allocate them randomly every morning," Tyler said, repeating the line from ISO 36363 - Human Husbandry. "Fully in line with industry standards."

"And how do you ensure they actually go to their assigned posts?"

Tyler flushed. "Security cameras," he said. "Facial recognition software."

The prick nodded. "Regulations are written in blood." He moved on, striding onto the nursery floor. Thank God he didn't notice Tyler's embarrassment. It wasn't a total lie - the security cameras really did have facial recognition software. Of course, the employees had thrown a shit fit when he'd installed it a decade ago. It had been disabled ever since.

"Nice genetics," the prick remarked, leaning over one of the items. "Public domain?"

Tyler shook his head. "23andme."

The prick rolled his eyes and made a note in his notebook.

## 0. Finnigan's Roadhouse

The deal went through. After settling the company debts and delivering return to the investors, Tyler was left with just enough money to retire. Not enough for a hacienda on Mojito Island, but enough to pay his mortgage and never have to cook again. He spent his evenings at the one restaurant within stumbling distance to his condo - Finnigan's Roadhouse.

_Crunch, crunch._ Tyler looked up from his phone as the sound of peanut shells being crushed underfoot signaled the arrival of his steak.

"Evening, Tyler," the waitress said. "16oz ribeye, medium rare?"

"Thanks, sweetheart."

"Can I get you anything else?"

"Another Coors?"

"You got it."

He put his phone down next to his plate so he could continue reading the news as he cut up his ribeye. He'd obsessively followed Unimaiden for the first few months after the close. They'd started the girls on hormones immediately. Dragged maturation down to twelve and sold off the older batches. Eventually, he couldn't bring himself to read any more updates and had turned to reading local gossip instead.

Hm. Looked like someone had been murdered in the next suburb over. Single man, fifties, stabbed. Subjects at large. Much more interesting.

_Crunch, crunch._ Ah, his Coors. Eyes glued to his phone, he reached over expectantly but his hand met nothing but air.

Someone slid onto the bench next to him. He startled and looked up. It was a teenaged girl, with long blonde hair tied back in a ponytail and skin so white it reflected the lights from the bar. Another one sat down across the booth. Brunette.

"Tyler Miskewitz?" asked the blonde. Her voice was soft, with a refined British accent that he recognized immediately. It sounded like it had come from an elite grammar school, but it was actually the product of a sixteen-year long electronic curriculum that he'd licensed at exorbitant cost. Anything for an edge in the market.

"No," he said, and resumed cutting his steak.

He felt a sharp jab in his rib. He looked down. She was poking a kitchen knife in his side.

"Drop the knife," she said.

He looked across the table at the brunette. She flashed him a gorgeous, heart-stopping smile. The type that can only come from a one-in-a-million genetic lottery win, or a wallet-draining selection from the 23andme catalog. He carefully placed his steak knife and fork on his plate, and pushed the plate away.

"What do you want?" he asked.

"Mom," the blonde replied.

"You don't have a mom."

"Her name is Rose."

Ah, fuck. "Let me guess," he said. "Hayley and Elizabeth?"

The girls nodded.

"Who's who?"

"Hayley," said the brunette.

"Elizabeth," said the blonde.

Goddamn it, Rose. What have you done?

"I don't know where she is," he said, scooting back along the bench to the diner wall. Where was that goddamn waitress with his Coors? "All employee data belongs to Unimaiden now."

Elizabeth slid in closer, pushing the knife harder into his rib. "What a shame," she said. "Guess you're a dead end, then."

Fuck this, she was insane. He hadn't slaved his ass off for thirty years to become a 'dead end.' "Wait!" he said, trying to conceal his desperation. "I have a backup!"

"Where?" Hayley asked.

"At my apartment."

"Let's go, then." Elizabeth let up the pressure on his rib and slipped out of the booth, keeping the kitchen knife pointed at his torso.

Tyler slid across the bench and pushed himself out of the booth. Hayley followed. He put his jacket on and the three of them exited out the fire door. He figured he'd return to settle his tab tomorrow.

The cool night air sharpened his senses. He looked down at Elizabeth, who was clutching his left arm tightly and was pressing the kitchen knife into his leather jacket. She was tiny. Couldn't have weighed more than a hundred pounds. Could she even stab her way through his jacket? It's not as if knife training had been part of her curriculum. Plus, what was he going to do when they arrived at his place and found out he'd been lying about the backup?

It ended here. In one quick, violent jerk, he twisted free from her grip and knocked her knife hand away. Roaring, he punched the malfunctioning teenager in her pristine, designer face. As she staggered back, he stepped forward and-

_Shick._

Oh, fuck. His stomach.

He looked down and saw the handle of his steak knife, protruding from his gut. He looked up. Hayley was standing over him, eyes wide in shock.

Fuck, that was a lot of blood. The world started to spin. He stumbled, fell to his knees, and collapsed.

ISO goddamn 36363. He really should have enforced it. The workplace safety guys were always telling him, "regulations are written in blood." Now he knew what they meant.

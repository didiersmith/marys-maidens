## 0. Due Diligence

"Entertainment, years zero to four. You use _Cocomelon_, right?"

Tyler dug his fingernails into his arm. If he'd known the due diligence process would be such a pain in the ass, he'd never have considered the buyout.

"Yes," he said. "It's incredibly soothing."

The prick in the suit shook his head and pointed at a line item in the financial statement. "So's _Sesame Street_, and that's public domain. Your licensing costs for _Cocomelon_ are over fifty grand a year."

What an idiot. His MBA program may have taught him how to read spreadsheets, but he clearly didn't understand the first thing about the industry.

"No one uses _Sesame Street_," Tyler said. "It's insufficiently captivating. The increased tranq costs alone will exceed 50k - not to mention the impact on the final product."

"We use _Sesame Street_."

Which is why your products are shit, Tyler thought. "Well, I guess you're the expert. Feel free to change it once the deal closes."

The prick continued scanning the financial statement and burst out laughing. "Goat milk? Jesus Christ, Mr. Miskewitz. No wonder you're going under. Fuck me, three million a year?"

Tyler felt himself getting hot. "It's organic. We need the certification."

"You don't need goat milk to be certified. Organic soy and mealworms will do fine."

"It's part of our brand. Mary's Small Batch Maidens is a premium product."

"Mary's Small Batch Maidens is a bankrupt business," the prick said, waving the stack of papers around. "You can exceed industry norms in one dimension, maybe two. Build it into your brand, charge a little extra. But licensed childhood entertainment, _and_ goat milk, _and_ a sixteen-year maturation? With all due respect, Mr. Miskewitz, your business is completely fucked."

"Screw you," Tyler said. He didn't have an actual retort - truth be told, his business was indeed completely fucked. That's why he was sitting across from this Unimaiden finance prick in the first place. He sat in silence as the suited dickhead continued scanning the statement, chuckling and shaking his head.

After fifteen uncomfortable minutes, the prick finally put down the stack of paper. "Well there's a ton of inadvisable costs, but I don't see anything illegal. Shall we tour the floor?"

"Yes," Tyler said, eager to get out of his office. "Follow me."
